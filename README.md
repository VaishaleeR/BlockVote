# Electoblock
The e-voting system aims to eliminate the
bottlenecks evident in the manual voting system such as the lengthy registration process,
unnecessary transportation, election violence and ultimately the incredibility of the votes.
This was achieved by developing a time effective registration platform which registers a
voter and assigns a voter their voter cards immediately. The voter also gets to vote from
their nearest safe and convenient polling unit and their votes is counted where it belongs.
The results obtained from subsequent tests were very impressive in terms of time, security
and accuracy as compared to the manual system. Such system with all these capabilities will
go a long in ameliorating the problems of the existing manual system of voting in the Indian
electoral process. 

Project Site/ Tools used:
• Ganache: We used ganache software to have local Ethereum blockchain for testing the
Solidity contracts. It provides more features when compared to Remix.
• Node Js: Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime
environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web
browser. 
• Visual Studio Code: Visual Studio Code is a freeware source-code editor made by
Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax
highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.
• Meta Mask: Meta Mask is a browser extension and also cryptocurrency wallet used to
interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet
through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to interact with
decentralized applications. 
Solidity: In this project we use Solidity language, which facilitates writing smart contract
which provides the block chain support. And we have used Ethereum block chain to store
votes and everything it supports solidity for writing smart contract.
React: React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library or building user
interfaces based on UI components.
HTML: HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It allows the user to create and
structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and
applications.
Css: Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language
intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
 Js: JavaScript is a client-side scripting language, which means the source code is processed
by the client's web browser rather than on the web server. This means JavaScript functions
can run after a webpage has loaded without communicating with the server.
